title: "Health Promotion + Behavior Change Exhibition 2020"
summary: As the focus of healthcare services expands beyond medical supply, there is increasing interest in the use of health communication campaigns and behavioral interventions to reduce the healthcare burden through effective health promotion and disease prevention. At the start of the January 2020, the 02.230TS Health Communication and Behavior Change students from SUTD were tasked by the Singapore Health Promotion Board to come up with ideas to tackle various health issues.

As healthcare moves beyond medicine to include preventive approaches, there is increasing interest in the use of health communication campaigns and behavioral interventions to reduce the healthcare burden through effective health promotion and disease prevention. At the start of the January 2020, the **02.230TS Health Communication and Behavior Change** students from SUTD were tasked by the Singapore Health Promotion Board to come up with ideas to tackle various health issues. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, their physical exhibitions had to be migrated online, and instead, they are showcasing their ideas here in this virtual exhibition. These include fascinating ideas from the **ALL-lympics**, which uses Facebook and Instagram AR filters to encourage physical activity among youths, to **Dr. Jiao** (believe it or not), that incorporates computer vision into dating applications to scan _(gasp!)_ pictures of genitalia for physical symptoms of STDs. These are health interventions developed by youths, for youths, and I hope you enjoy the exhibition from the comfort of your home. Feel free to contact the project groups if you are interested in furthering their ideas!

**The All-lympics: AR Filters to Reduce Sedentary Time**: Three quarters of Singapore adolescents do not get sufficient physical activity according to a WHO study released in 2019. By tapping on the success and influence of social media, the campaign, ALL-lympics , tackles this issue through a collection of Facebook and Instagram Augmented Reality (AR) Filters that is designed to engage the youth and invoke interest in sports and encourage greater participation in physical activities. This allows for seamless implementation as these filters would be intuitive for youth to learn and use. These social media AR filters will revolve about the theme of Olympic sporting games. Through the established connection of familiarity and popularity that people have with the Olympics, we hope to further encourage Singaporean youths to experience and garner interests for sports when playing these Olympic sports-themed AR filters. The incorporation of a game-like structure also allows for fun challenges to be introduced that both engage as well as challenge the user. With easy access for sports facility booking in-built within the filter, paired with the engaging game-like Olympic themed design, it allows subliminal messaging to be introduced, to change the attitude and behavior of youth toward exercise. <br/>

**“Okay? Not Okay.”** is a campaign for youths to show support for those fighting depression, encouraging help-seeking behaviour among depressed individuals. According to The Stage Model of Self-Stigma (SMSS), the public stigma that people suffering from depression are weak leads to internalization and self-stigmatization in depressed individuals. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) further explains why resultant negative attitudes account for low rates of help-seeking behaviour. To address this “treatment gap”, we formulated a 3-pronged approach aimed at invoking attitudinal and behavioural changes in the community. Firstly, the EAST framework is used to create positive attitudes towards depression in the #itsok2notbeok challenge. Individuals can show their support for depression through an easy and interactive way - Instagram Stories. This reduces public stigma via the bandwagon effect. Secondly, the main Instagram page shares experiences of individuals living with depression, and educates the public about the illness. Motivational posts increase control beliefs of depressed individuals (TPB). Sharers will also reduce self-stigmatization after opening up (SMSS). Lastly, viewers can participate in activities and moderated discussions on Instagram Live to interact with peers who overcame depression. Based on Allport’s intergroup contact theory, this direct contact with the stigmatised group further reduces negative public stigma.

**Sweet Spot**: Diabetes is a serious global health issue that is affecting Singapore as well. Sweet Spot targets diabetic patients, those at risk of diabetes and health-conscious Singaporeans looking for a low-sugar diet. Sweet Spot believes in a community effort in combating diabetes, and is a novel platform where healthier diets, lifestyles, and ideas are shared. Users can recommend low-sugar food products, recipes and diet ideas to each other. Sweet Spot is built around a unique recommender rating system that provides score users based on the satisfaction of the recipients of their recommendations and the healthiness of food products recommended. With a rich database of food products and their nutritional information, the app assigns each product a unique “goodness” score based on the levels of sodium, fat, protein, calories etc. and most importantly sugar. The app is designed in a way to recognize users who provide good recommendations. Lastly, the app features a unique community diet tracking feature which allows users to track and share their sugar intake so that family and friends can monitor and encourage each other in their journey.

**Together, We Can Reach The Moon**: To encourage students to pick the stairs over escalator during their journey at train stations, our group seeks to revamp the user experience of stairs taking. Through gamification, we hope that students will find it more as a fun and engaging activity, rather than a chore. Taking the public transport is a routine procedure for the majority, passengers have low ability to think when they are rushing and have little motivation to think about exercise, so targeting System 1 thinking and peripheral route processing will be more effective. Specifically, we turned to the Easy, Attractive, Social and Time framework as a reference for the nudges needed to drive students towards picking stairs, over the escalator. Why is our proposed solution effective? Our solution integrates physical activity into a student’s otherwise sedentary train journey, giving them the excitement from the accumulation of points and competition with other schools. This feeds into the students’ need to feel challenged and need to display competency and superiority.
