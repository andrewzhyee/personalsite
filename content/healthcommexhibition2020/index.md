title: "Health Promotion + Behavior Change Exhibition 2020"
summary: As the focus of healthcare services expands beyond medical supply, there is increasing interest in the use of health communication campaigns and behavioral interventions to reduce the healthcare burden through effective health promotion and disease prevention. At the start of the January 2020, the 02.230TS Health Communication and Behavior Change students from SUTD were tasked by the Singapore Health Promotion Board to come up with ideas to tackle various health issues.

  caption: Okay? Not Okay. is a campaign for youths to show support for those fighting depression, encouraging help-seeking behaviour among depressed individuals. According to The Stage Model of Self-Stigma, the public stigma that people suffering from depression are weak leads to internalization and self-stigmatization in depressed individuals. The Theory of Planned Behaviour further explains why resultant negative attitudes account for low rates of help-seeking behaviour. To address this treatment gap, we formulated a 3-pronged approach aimed at invoking attitudinal and behavioural changes in the community. Firstly, the EAST framework is used to create positive attitudes towards depression in the #itsok2notbeok challenge. Individuals can show their support for depression through an easy and interactive way - Instagram Stories. This reduces public stigma via the bandwagon effect. Secondly, the main Instagram page shares experiences of individuals living with depression, and educates the public about the illness. Motivational posts increase control beliefs of depressed individuals. Sharers will also reduce self-stigmatization after opening up. Lastly, viewers can participate in activities and moderated discussions on Instagram Live to interact with peers who overcame depression. Based on Allport’s intergroup contact theory, this direct contact with the stigmatised group further reduces negative public stigma.

  caption: Currently, there is a high percentage of young adults, age between 17 to 24 that are leading a sedentary lifestyle at home due to prolonged sitting and too little movement in their daily lives. HPB is aware of the problems of sedentary lifestyle and has created the Healthy365 app to tackle this issue. However, it might not be that effective in targeting youths as research has shown that only 20-25% of tertiary and post-tertiary have downloaded the app and less than half of them are active users. One reason could be due to the complicated and unintuitive UI of the app which discourages young adults from using. Our proposed solution is to reinvent the UI of the Healthy365 app, with additional features to it. One of them is the active exercise planner which will aid app users in actively planning out their exercise routines weekly. It includes features such as rankings, group incentives and stretched goals with groups. Additionally, we designed the app icon to mimic the users’ level of activeness in exercising. Hence, we hope our proposed solution will be able to intrigue the young adults into using the healthy365 app and exercise more actively.

  caption: Makan Time Kaypoh Time is a campaign that aims to decrease the perception among university students that mental health is a taboo subject, and to encourage them to speak about their mental well-being more frequently over a period of two months. This is because recent studies have shown an increasing number of young people experiencing mental disorders. Moreover, with the existing stigma against mental illness, those in need feel discouraged to seek the necessary advice from a therapist. Our campaign aims to achieve the aforementioned objectives by strategically introducing conversation prompts and self-efficacy messages via brochures placed on university canteen tables. These brochures serve as a nudge for starting conversations about mental well-being. To encourage the behaviour change, the campaign made it "Easy, Attractive, Social and Timely" to start mental health conversations. The proposed intervention also leveraged on the Social Cognitive Theory to increase students' self-efficacy beliefs via vicarious experiences and verbal persuasion. The campaign’s effectiveness lies on the strategy of informalising the conversations and targeting mealtime specifically. Additionally, the campaign features are supported by relevant theories to enhance the effectiveness.

  caption: Medication non-adherence is an issue within the healthcare sector, especially among the elderly. This is often due to forgetfulness and the complexity involved when taking their medication. This proposed pill dispenser automatically sorts and dispenses pills into a capsule-shaped container, and the elderly only need to retrieve it to take their medication. When it is time for medication, a pre-recorded video of the grandchildren reminding the elderly to take their medication is casted on the device of the elderly’s choice (e.g. television, phone). As the elderly are likely to dote on their grandchildren, they are motivated to maintain their health by following their regimen. On the capsule-shaped container, there is a lucky number to help the elderly associate medication taking when they check the 4D/TOTO results at 6.30 p.m. The proposed solution is backed by the theory of planned behaviour which theorizes that medication adherence improves when the elderly are motivated to consume their medication and when the process is made easy. With better medication adherence, it can potentially improve individual health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs in the long run.

As the focus of healthcare services expands beyond medical supply, there is increasing interest in the use of health communication campaigns and behavioral interventions to reduce the healthcare burden through effective health promotion and disease prevention. At the start of the January 2020, the **02.230TS Health Communication and Behavior Change** students from SUTD were tasked by the Singapore Health Promotion Board to come up with ideas to tackle various health issues. Due to the COVID-19 situation, their physical exhibitions had to be migrated online, and this page will be showcasing their final projects, which include theoretically-informed health promotion campaigns and interventions that tackle the most pertinent health issues in our society today! <br/> <br/>
