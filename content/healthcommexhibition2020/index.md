As healthcare moves beyond medicine to include preventive approaches, there is increasing interest in the use of health communication campaigns and behavioral interventions to reduce the healthcare burden through effective health promotion and disease prevention. At the start of the January 2020, the **02.230TS Health Communication and Behavior Change** students from SUTD were tasked by the Singapore Health Promotion Board to come up with ideas to tackle various health issues. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, their physical exhibitions had to be migrated online, and instead, they are showcasing their ideas here in this virtual exhibition. These include fascinating ideas from the **ALL-lympics**, which uses Facebook and Instagram AR filters to encourage physical activity among youths, to **Dr. Jiao** (believe it or not), that incorporates computer vision into dating applications to scan _(gasp!)_ pictures of genitalia for physical symptoms of STDs. These are health interventions developed by youths, for youths, and I hope you enjoy the exhibition from the comfort of your home. Feel free to contact the project groups if you are interested in furthering their ideas! <br/> <br/>
