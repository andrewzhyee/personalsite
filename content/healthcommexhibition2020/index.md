As healthcare moves beyond medicine to include preventive approaches, there is increasing interest in the use of health communication campaigns and behavioral interventions to reduce the healthcare burden through effective health promotion and disease prevention. At the start of the January 2020, the **02.230TS Health Communication and Behavior Change** students from SUTD were tasked by the Singapore Health Promotion Board to come up with ideas to tackle various health issues. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, their physical exhibitions had to be migrated online, and instead, they are showcasing their ideas here in this virtual exhibition. These include fascinating ideas from the **ALL-lympics**, which uses Facebook and Instagram AR filters to encourage physical activity among youths, to **Dr. Jiao** (believe it or not), that incorporates computer vision into dating applications to scan _(gasp!)_ pictures of genitalia for physical symptoms of STDs. These are health interventions developed by youths, for youths, and I hope you enjoy the exhibition from the comfort of your home. Feel free to contact the project groups if you are interested in furthering their ideas! <br/> <br/>

**The All-lympics: AR Filters to Reduce Sedentary Time**
{{< figure src="alllympics.jpg" title="" lightbox="true" >}}
Three quarters of Singapore adolescents do not get sufficient physical activity according to a WHO study released in 2019. By tapping on the success and influence of social media, the campaign, ALL-lympics , tackles this issue through a **collection of Facebook and Instagram Augmented Reality (AR) Filters** that is designed to engage the youth and invoke interest in sports and encourage greater participation in physical activities. This allows for seamless implementation as these filters would be intuitive for youth to learn and use. These social media AR filters will revolve about the theme of Olympic sporting games. Through the established connection of familiarity and popularity that people have with the Olympics, we hope to further encourage Singaporean youths to experience and garner interests for sports when playing these Olympic sports-themed AR filters. The incorporation of a game-like structure also allows for fun challenges to be introduced that both engage as well as challenge the user. With easy access for sports facility booking in-built within the filter, paired with the engaging game-like Olympic themed design, it allows subliminal messaging to be introduced, to change the attitude and behavior of youth toward exercise.

**Okay? Not Okay.**
{{< figure src="okaynotokay.jpg" title="" lightbox="true" >}}
“Okay? Not Okay.” is a campaign for youths to show support for those fighting depression, encouraging help-seeking behaviour among depressed individuals. According to The Stage Model of Self-Stigma (SMSS), the public stigma that people suffering from depression are weak leads to internalization and self-stigmatization in depressed individuals. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) further explains why resultant negative attitudes account for low rates of help-seeking behaviour. To address this “treatment gap”, we formulated a 3-pronged approach aimed at invoking attitudinal and behavioural changes in the community. Firstly, the EAST framework is used to create positive attitudes towards depression in the #itsok2notbeok challenge. Individuals can show their support for depression through an easy and interactive way - Instagram Stories. This reduces public stigma via the bandwagon effect. Secondly, the main Instagram page shares experiences of individuals living with depression, and educates the public about the illness. Motivational posts increase control beliefs of depressed individuals (TPB). Sharers will also reduce self-stigmatization after opening up (SMSS). Lastly, viewers can participate in activities and moderated discussions on Instagram Live to interact with peers who overcame depression. Based on Allport’s intergroup contact theory, this direct contact with the stigmatised group further reduces negative public stigma.
