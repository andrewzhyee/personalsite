  caption: Okay? Not Okay. is a campaign for youths to show support for those fighting depression, encouraging help-seeking behaviour among depressed individuals. According to The Stage Model of Self-Stigma, the public stigma that people suffering from depression are weak leads to internalization and self-stigmatization in depressed individuals. The Theory of Planned Behaviour further explains why resultant negative attitudes account for low rates of help-seeking behaviour. To address this treatment gap, we formulated a 3-pronged approach aimed at invoking attitudinal and behavioural changes in the community. Firstly, the EAST framework is used to create positive attitudes towards depression in the #itsok2notbeok challenge. Individuals can show their support for depression through an easy and interactive way - Instagram Stories. This reduces public stigma via the bandwagon effect. Secondly, the main Instagram page shares experiences of individuals living with depression, and educates the public about the illness. Motivational posts increase control beliefs of depressed individuals. Sharers will also reduce self-stigmatization after opening up. Lastly, viewers can participate in activities and moderated discussions on Instagram Live to interact with peers who overcame depression. Based on Allport’s intergroup contact theory, this direct contact with the stigmatised group further reduces negative public stigma.

  caption: Currently, there is a high percentage of young adults, age between 17 to 24 that are leading a sedentary lifestyle at home due to prolonged sitting and too little movement in their daily lives. HPB is aware of the problems of sedentary lifestyle and has created the Healthy365 app to tackle this issue. However, it might not be that effective in targeting youths as research has shown that only 20-25% of tertiary and post-tertiary have downloaded the app and less than half of them are active users. One reason could be due to the complicated and unintuitive UI of the app which discourages young adults from using. Our proposed solution is to reinvent the UI of the Healthy365 app, with additional features to it. One of them is the active exercise planner which will aid app users in actively planning out their exercise routines weekly. It includes features such as rankings, group incentives and stretched goals with groups. Additionally, we designed the app icon to mimic the users’ level of activeness in exercising. Hence, we hope our proposed solution will be able to intrigue the young adults into using the healthy365 app and exercise more actively.
