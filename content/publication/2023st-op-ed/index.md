abstract = "In this op-ed, my colleague discuss why we - as a society - need to destigmatize screen time. Based on our experience conducting fieldwork across Singapore, we note that screen time guidelines can sometimes engender strong feelings of parental guilt and disempowerment. We argue that there is a need to instead view screen time as screen experience, and that the responsibility of ensuring high quality screen experiences falls not only on parents, but the technological companies that profit from children's attention."
