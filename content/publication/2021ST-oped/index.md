abstract = "In this op-ed, Professor Lim Sun Sun and I discuss the importance of going beyond a time-based understanding of media use for children. Instead, we highlight the importance of content, context, intention, and risk mitigation. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of parent-child communication and negotiation, rather than parents using authoritarian and top-down strategies to deal with media use. Overall, we highlight the need to view screen time as opportunities for learning and bonding, rather than something to tackle."
