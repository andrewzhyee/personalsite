I am currently SUTD Faculty Fellow at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. My research focuses on understanding how social and technological environments shape the health and well-being of individuals. I am currently working on a number of research projects related to media use among children and youths and how it affects their well-being, parent-child communication and nutrition, as well as technological acceptance for health among the elderly. One of the more exciting projects I am working on right now is the collection and analysis of young people's screenomes in Singapore, and identifying how different strains of media use can affect youth well-being.

I have published widely in scholarly journals such as the Journal of Health Communication, Computers in Human Behavior, the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, the International Journal of Advertising, Vaccine, and the Oxford Encyclopedia of Communication.
