I’m currently an Assistant Professor at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, where I study how and why people use digital technology, and its impact on development and well-being. My current research projects spans three main areas: the effects of smartphones and social media on youth mental health, preschoolers’ screen media experiences, and how video games shape identity and well-being. Broadly, my work explores how digital media can be harnessed to support healthier development among children and adolescents.
