I am currently Assistant Professor in the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences Department at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. My research focuses on understanding how social and technological environments shape the health and well-being of individuals. Currently, I am working on a number of research projects related to media use among children and youths and how it affects their well-being, parent-child communication and dietary preferences among children, as well as technological affordances for health. One major project I am working on right now is the collection and analysis of young peopleâ€™s screenomes in Singapore, and identifying how different strains of media use affect youth well-being. A second major project I am working on is in understanding what constitutes high- versus low-quality digital media use for preschoolers.
