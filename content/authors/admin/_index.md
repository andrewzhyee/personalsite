I am currently Assistant Professor at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information. I am generally interested in understanding how and why people use digital technology, and the impact it can have on their development and well-being. My latest work involves the collection of screenomes to better understand the impact of youth smartphone use. Another project involves understanding what aspects of media use contributes to different dimensions of preschoolers’ school readiness - such as literacy, socioemotional competency, and executive function. Overall, my work aims to explore how technology and digital media can be harnessed to positively affect children’s development.
