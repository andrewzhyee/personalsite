I am currently Assistant Professor in the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences Department at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. My research interests lie in the intersection between digital technology and human development. My latest work involves the collection of screenomes to better understand and dissect youth smartphone use. Another current project involves understanding what aspects of media use contributes to preschoolers' school readiness. Overall, my work aims to explore how message design, technology, and digital media can be harnessed to positively affect childrenâ€™s development.
