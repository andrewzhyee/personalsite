**EMBRACE: A technologically enabled ecosytem for active ageing** <br/>
In this multidisciplinary project, our research team at SUTD is developing a technologically-enabled ecosystem built around a wearable device, a smartphone, and a volunteer network in order to encourage active ageing among the elderly and enhance social resilience in Singaporean neighbourhoods. As Co-I in this project (share ~SGD60,000), I adopted a community participatory approach to understand the barriers to technological adoption among seniors for health, which informs the design of the ecosystem, as well as future health technology intervention targeted at seniors.
