**EMBRACE: A technologically enabled ecosytem for active ageing**
In this multidisciplinary project, our research team at SUTD - consisting of Subburaj Karupppasamy, Lim Kwan Hui, Simon Perrault, Mohan Rajesh Elara, and myself - are developing a technologically-enabled ecosystem built around a wearable device, a smartphone, and a volunteer network in order to encourage active ageing among the elderly and enhance social resilience in Singaporean neighbourhoods. As Co-PI in this SGD601,000 funded project, I adopted a community participatory approach to understand the barriers to technological adoption among the elderly for health, which informs the design of the ecosystem. The research team are also aiming to pilot test the effects of this technological ecosystem using a rigorous randomized controlled design on elderly and volunteers' physical activity and mental well-being in the near future.
