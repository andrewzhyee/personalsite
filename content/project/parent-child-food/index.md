My main research project in this area aims to delineate and identify how features of parental communication, in conjunction with the quality of parent-child relationship, can affect the eating habits of children. Specifically, I identify effective persuasive strategies parents can utilize to encourage food preferences among children. In this research project, I have conducted a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of various parenting strategies, developed a scale to measure different facets of parental guidance regarding food, as well as conducted a nationally representative survey to examine the theoretical processes behind these persuasive strategies. Working with the Singapore Health Promotion Board, the findings from these studies have also been translated into short parenting guides (examples below) that have been disseminated across many primary and secondary schools in Singapore.
