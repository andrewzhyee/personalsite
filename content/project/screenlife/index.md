**Adolescent smartphone use and mental well-being** <br/>
I am utilizing high-frequency screenshot data (or screenomics) to better understand the type and quality of smartphone media consumption among, and in identifying if differences in the type and quality of use can affect adolescent mental well-being. In this project, my team at SUTD are developing a proprietary software called ScreenLife Capture that unobtrusively captures high-frequency screenshots, providing rich in-situ smartphone use data which can be analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The video above provides a sample of screenshots derived from around 1 hour of use. <br/><br/>
**_I am actively looking for interested collaborators and students who have expertise in Android app development to join our research team working on this project. Please contact me if you are interested._**

**Healthy media consumption among young children** <br/>
I am also investigating what constitutes healthy forms of media consumption among younger children. Specifically, I look at the context (social interaction with parents during and around media consumption), technological affordances (interactive versus non-interactive), and content (developmentally appropriate) surrounding media consumption that can confer positive psychosocial and cognitive benefits for children.
