**Adolescent smartphone use and mental well-being** <br/>
I utilize high-frequency screenshot data (or screenomics) to better understand and identify the different types and quality of smartphone use among youths. In addition, I am also investigating if differences in the type and quality of smartphone use can affect youths' mental well-being. To do this, our team at SUTD has developed a proprietary software called ScreenLife Capture to unobtrusively capture high-frequency screenshots (every 5 seconds) on smartphones, providing rich behavioral smartphone use data which can be analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The video above provides a sample of screenshots derived from around 1 hour of use, collected using the ScreenLife Capture app. 

**Quality of media consumption among young children** <br/>
I am also investigating what constitutes healthy forms of media consumption among younger children. Specifically, I look at the context (social interaction with parents during and around media consumption), technological affordances (interactive versus non-interactive), and content (developmentally appropriate) surrounding media consumption that can confer positive psychosocial and cognitive benefits for children. This project is generously funded by the National Institute of Education Office of Education Research Tier 2 grant (SGD244,004).
