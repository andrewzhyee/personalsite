**Adolescent smartphone use and mental well-being** <br/>
I utilize high-frequency screenshot data (or screenomics) to better understand and identify the different types and quality of smartphone use among youths. In addition, I am also investigating if differences in the type and quality of smartphone use can affect various facets of young people's mental well-being. To do this, our team at SUTD developed an open-source and freely available software called ScreenLife Capture to unobtrusively capture high-frequency screenshots (every 5 seconds) on smartphones, providing rich behavioral smartphone use data which can be analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The video above provides a participants' screenshots from around 1 hour of use, collected using the ScreenLife Capture app. The manuscript and code for our open-source software is currently under review, and will be shared when it is published.

**Quality of media consumption among young children** <br/>
I am also investigating what constitutes healthy forms of media consumption among younger children. Specifically, I look at the context (social interaction with parents during and around media consumption), technological affordances (interactive versus non-interactive), and content (developmentally appropriate) surrounding media consumption that can confer positive psychosocial and cognitive benefits for children. We use a blend of qualitative and quantitative techniques to understand this phenomena. This project is funded by the National Institute of Education Office of Education Research Tier 2 grant (SGD244,004).
